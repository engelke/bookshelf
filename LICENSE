This application includes other software, covered under other licenses.

The jQuery JavaScript library (jquery.js) is used here under the terms of the
MIT license, but is available under either that license or the GNU
General Public License (GPL) Version 2. More information is available
at http://jquery.org/license/ .

The Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library (sjcl.js) is used here under the terms of
the BSD license, but is available under either that license or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2. More information is available
at http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/ . This application does not include
the entire library, but only those routines used for calculating
SHA-256 HMAC signatures. The build included here does not include any cipher
routines, so I believe that it does not include any patented code.

The icons used here (icon_128.png and icon_16.png) are used here under
the terms of the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution license. They are available
at http://designmoo.com/4189/awesome-book-icon/ and are called
Book_icon_by_@akterpnd.
